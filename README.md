# Generative Adversarial Networks
This project is based on Assignment 6 from Deep Learning for Computer Vision Course from University of michigan ( EECS 498-007 / 598-005) .

# Project Description 
* At this project I generated a synthetic data from MNIST Dataset using Gans.
* The main goal of the project is to understand the theory and the implementation behind Gans models.
* The Project was written in pyton using pytorch framework.
* The main coding part in the assignment is on gan.py.

# How to Run the Project
1. Fork and upload the project to google drive
2. Open 'generative_adversarial_networks.ipynb' and follow the instructions.

# What Next?
* Feel free to try to generate a different synthetic dataset.
